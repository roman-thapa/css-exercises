<!-- since all odd number shared same tag i.e. "p" so i didn't give any class to them but used p tag for their style after watching the solution i realized its not the same but what they wanted to teach was to us to use a class with same name to reduce the work then using p would reduce it even further so i used it but i achieved it in "Number 3 & 4" by using num class that's why i didn't used class in "p" -->
